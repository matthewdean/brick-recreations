Classic Pieces
==============

![](classic-pieces.png)

Notes
-----
* Unsure if the knight's design is correct
* In the game, some pieces on the pawn, bishop, and queen are oriented at 45 degrees. Those same pieces, when shown in a cutscene, are oriented at 90 degrees
* The opening cutscene shows an axle sticking out of the partially assembled king piece, which has not been accounted for in this build

Buildability
------------
Piece | Buildable in White? | Buildable in Black? | Reason
-- | -- | -- | --
King | No | Yes | Inverted funnel not available in white
Queen | No | Yes | Inverted funnel not available in white
Bishop | No | Yes | Inverted funnel not available in white
